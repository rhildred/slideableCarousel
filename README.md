I couldn't find an example that tied everything that I needed to do together. This example also has process management with [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and [parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org/).

To run this:

1. clone or download this repository
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start` by default listens on port 3000 or $port
1. run `npm restart` after making changes
1. run `npm stop` to stop altogether and use the port for something else
1. run `npm run log` to see the logs
